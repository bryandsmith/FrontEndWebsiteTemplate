# FrontEndWebsiteTemplate
This is my first project with front end development. It serves as a simple website template, featuring several coding styles used commonly in websites.

Features include responsive pages, flexbox design, CSS gird design, JSON controls, a CSS photo carousel, an imedded video, and HTML5 features such as form validation and responsive picture tags.
